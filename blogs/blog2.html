                <h2>In the true spirit of FIRST, three team members of Legogoa
                    Axi0m 22855 decided to combine outreach and raising funds
                    into one event and they did it successfully by conducting a
                    nominally paid robotics workshop called â€œExplore the World
                    of Robotics.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The team members, Venkatesh Dempo, Shounak Hede and Dhruv
                    Desai (aka Team VSD) conducted their first workshop on 4th
                    December, 2022 at Goa's capital city of Panaji and their
                    second workshop on 8th December, 2022 at Margao. 12 students
                    each in the age group of 7 to 13 years attended the
                    workshop. The duration of the workshop was 3 hours and each
                    student was charged a fee of Rs. 500.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The workshop started with a brief introduction of the
                    trainers and the purpose of the workshop and FTC. The
                    participants were made aware of the basics of coding through
                    a Powerpoint presentation. The participants were then taught
                    to create a robot using Lego EV3 kit and then program the
                    robot to perform a specific task.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The aim of the workshops was to create awareness and
                    enthusiasm amongst young participants about the world of
                    Robotics and to give them hands-on experience in assembling
                    a robot and coding it. The participants displayed keen
                    interest in learning and exploring new things.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In true spirit of FIRST the trio raised Rs 12,000/- for the
                    team via the fees received from the participants.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The workshops were well appreciated by young participants
                    and their parents. The trio thanked the participants for
                    supporting their initiative of fundraising for the FTC
                    championship.</h2>
